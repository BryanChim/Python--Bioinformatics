Python--Bioinformatics-Parsers-Pipelines
========================================
A small collection of Python projects/pipelines/scripts for parsing and analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. See the README.txt files in each directory for more information on the respective project.

* Further documentation/explanation of the PRACTICUM--Oral_Microbiome_Browser is still to come -- but the application itself works fine if you'd like to try it out (located in the repo "Python-Django--Oral_Microbiome_Browser")

* Currently working on integrated pipelines for the RNA-seq analysis tools, Tuxedo/cummeRbund(eukaryotes) and EDGE-pro/DESeq(prokaryotes)
