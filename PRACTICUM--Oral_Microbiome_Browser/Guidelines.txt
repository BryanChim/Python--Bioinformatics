- Presentation should be for 15 minutes plus 2-3 mins of QA section.
- Presentation should include 

- Description of the problem

periodontitus/pyorrhea - set of inflammatory disease affecting periodontium (tissues supporting/surrounding teeth). loss of alveolar bone around teeth -> loosening and loss of teeth. 
- caused by microorganisms + over-aggressive immune response
- major categories include gingivitis, periodontic-endodontic lesions, chronic/aggressive periodontitis, necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis, abscesses of the periodontium
- deep pockets between teeth and gums - caused by destrogen of collagen by collagenases - gingival fibers, gum tissues separate from tooth and deepened sulcus -> periodontal pocket

periodontium: 
GINGIVA - gum tissue
CEMENTUM - outer layer of roots of teeth
ALVEOLAR BONE - bony sockets in which teeth anchored
PERIODONTAL LIGAMENTS - (PDLs) connective tissue fibers between cementum and alveolar bone

CAUSE:
poor oral hygiene, accumulation of bacterial/mycotic matrix at gum line - dental plaque, poor nutrition, linked to diabetes
CALCULUS - calcified microbial plaque, aka tartar -> must be completely removed by dentist to treat gingivitis/periodontitis

P. gingivalis - colonizes oral epithelium, virulence factors include extracellular proteases that can modulate immune system, affect epithelial cell proteins and receptors, a lipopolysaccharide that induces pathogenic immune response
- toxins of invading bacteria can cause cell death and tooth decay, which can spread to underlying bone

periodontal disease, caries, increase complexity and composition of oral biofilm
periodontal disease due to plaque biofilm affecting periodontal tissues

Primary: compare oral microbiome in deep vs shallow sites (disease vs healthy). 

Secondary: evaluate influence of smoking, race, dental caries 
- Periodontitis, gum infection, destroys bone and damages soft tissue
- discover and target species that have significantly greater abundancy in diseased sites
- develop better periodontal therapeutic methods to slow/stop periodontitis


- build an online explorer to perform analyses interactively


- Description of dataset
92 subjects from 2 clinics: VCU and WISE
Paired samples taken from each subject
Deep: (probe site depth > 5 mm)
Shallow: (probe site depth < 3 mm)
Amplified and sequenced V4-V6 region of 16s rRNA sequences
pyrosequencing


- Analysis methods
Differences in genera/species due to deep vs shallow sites analyzed by two-part model and false discovery rate

51 of 170 genera significantly different in abundancies between deep/shallow
200 of 746 species significantly different in abundancies between deep/shallow

* normal conditions: predominant phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria

"Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria - significant reduction in disease sites
Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes - significant increase in disease sites. 



Hierarchical Trees Cluster analysis -> microbiome difference between deep and shallow significantly influenced by clinic location, race, caries status gender, smoking. 

 assemble profile by taxonomy and calculate read counts, % of sample and average score

- Workflow of your project
RDP Classifier, 0.5 and 0.8 thresholds
Parse Classified File
Extract and format data for loading into database
Assemble interactive html pages with python/django




- Database design
Construction of Models
Project, Sample, SampleAttribute, Taxa, ClassificationMethod, Profile Summary

- Sample, ReadId Taxa Name and Level if taxa's score meets threshold
- Calculate #reads, % of sample, avg score --> profile summary for each taxa
- From PRofile Summary, extract and compile a list of all taxa and their levels
- Map, collapse and retrieve sample attributes and their values from the Clinical Data Set



- Web application demo 



- Anything else you can think of which is related to project


Report should also follow the same flow as presentation but it is in more detailed written report. Report will be 5-8 pages long.  

Due date for Report is May 11th, Noon.  

Please let me know if you have any questions. See you at Tuesday at 2 pm May 6th. 

Thanks,
Nihar
