This is an extensive bioinformatics project that I completed for my graduate practicum. The final product is an interactive browser-based application that can search for/filter information on the oral microbiome of dental patient samples. 

The Python-Django app files are located in separate repository on my Github -- "Python-Django--Oral_Microbiome_Browser" 
* Link: https://github.com/BryanChim/Python-Django--Oral_Microbiome_Browser


If you have Python-Django installed on your system, you can try out this browser with the following steps:

1) Clone the repository above to your computer

2) Open your command-line/shell and navigate to said repository on your computer

3) Enter >python manage.py runserver

4) Open your web browser of choice, and navigate to the URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

5) Enjoy!  


- If you're unable or do not wish to run the application, you can view screenshots of the interface in the images "Django Pages.jpg" and "Django Pages2.jpg"
